# Multitrack Visualizer

A small tool that loads multiple audio files at once and simultaneously renders
each of their waveforms to PNG.

I plan on using this for [my YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/TomboFry),
where I upload chiptune music. I figured it would be a good visualisation tool,
and different from my usual screen capture of FL Studio.
